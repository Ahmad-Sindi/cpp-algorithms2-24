Algorithm Challenge #24 – Max of Random Array
-
🎲 Problem Description
-
This program fills an array with random numbers between 1 and 100, prints all elements, and finally displays the maximum value in the array.

This challenge improves understanding of randomization, looping, and searching within arrays.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
Generating random numbers within a range

Filling and iterating through arrays

Finding the maximum element using comparisons

Basic array traversal patterns

Writing clean and modular C++ functions

🧩 Example
-
Input:

Enter number of elements:
10


Output (example):

Array Elements: 35 92 14 77 3 88 20 61 100 44

Max number in array: 100


📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: max_random_array.cpp

Challenge Number: #24

💬 Notes
-
This is a fundamental challenge for improving logic related to array traversal and comparison operations.
It builds a foundation for more advanced algorithms like sorting and searching.
